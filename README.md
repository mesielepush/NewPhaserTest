# Fantastic Phaser RPG game
 This is a short RPG game written in JS with the Phaser3 module.

  It was made to test the capabilities of the module, which are ok. However I'm pretty sure I just scratch the surface. The module it's very big and there are not too much users out there, so it's a little slower to learn than  popular engines likes Godot or Unity.

## History of this case.

Since I was new at Phaser 3, the design of the game was pointing more to the sense that RPG games have of developing a story. I was pushing for the sensation of mistery and discovery of those types of games. However this project was made in a week so again, same as with exploring the Phaser documentation, the story and the player capabilities are merly superficial, but, of course, they have a lot of heart. 


## Play instructions.

Except for the last battle that uses the mouse, every other part is played with the classic 'W,A,S,D' pc keys.  


## Installation  
  To install just clone the repository. Open the directory and run  ```yarn install``` into the console. Then just type: ```yarn watch ```. And open the ```index.html``` on Chrome.
