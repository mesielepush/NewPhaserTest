# Fantastic Phaser RPG game
 This is a short RPG game written in JS with the Phaser3 module.

  It was made to test the capabilities of the module, which are ok. However I'm pretty sure I just scratch the surface. The module it's very big and there are not too much users out there, so it's a little slower to learn than  popular engines likes Godot or Unity.

## Installation  
  To install just clone the repository. Open the directory and run  ```yarn install``` into the console. Then just type: ```yarn watch ```. And open the ```index.html``` on Chrome.
